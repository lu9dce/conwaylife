a mathematical model that simulates the evolution of cells on a two-dimensional grid

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton created by the British mathematician John H. Conway in 1970. It is a mathematical model that simulates the evolution of cells on a two-dimensional grid. Each cell can be alive or dead, and its state evolves at each time step based on simple rules.

The game follows these rules:

1. **Survival:** A live cell survives if it has 2 or 3 live neighbors.
2. **Death:** A live cell dies from overpopulation (more than 3 live neighbors) or underpopulation (less than 2 live neighbors).
3. **Birth:** A dead cell comes to life if it has exactly 3 live neighbors.

These simple rules give rise to complex and often unpredictable patterns over time. Despite its simplicity, the Game of Life exhibits fascinating emergent behaviors and has been studied in fields such as complexity theory, computer science, and the life sciences.
